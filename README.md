Formal Verification of Cloud Native Components

> “The heaviest penalty for declining to rule is to be ruled by someone inferior to yourself.” 

― Plato, The Republic

# Introduction
Guardian is an omnibus repository for tooling to formally verify components of a cloud native system. As each component is fleshed out, it might become its own standalone project, or Guardian could become just a Swiss Army Knife of useful verification tools. TBD. Suggestions are welcome!
