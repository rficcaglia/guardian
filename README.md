Formal Verification of Cloud Native Components

> “The heaviest penalty for declining to rule is to be ruled by someone inferior to yourself.” 

― Plato, The Republic

# Introduction
Guardian is an omnibus repository for tooling to formally verify components of a cloud native system. As each component is fleshed out, it might become its own standalone project, or Guardian could become just a Swiss Army Knife of useful verification tools. TBD. Suggestions are welcome!

## Current Sub-Projects Under Active Investigation

* [Kubernetes RBAC Policy Verification](https://github.com/cncf/sig-security/pull/242)
* Kubernetes NetworkPolicy Verification
* Kubernetes Admission Control Verfication <sup> [example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ihFfEfgViKlUMbY2NKxaJzBkgHh-Phk5hqKTzK-NEEs/edit#bookmark=id.mdmvg9pwqh31) </sup>

## Ideas for Future Sub-Project Work

* Certificate (Lifecycle) Management Verification
* Supply Chain Management Verification
* Verification of "Defense in Depth", e.g. CVE Impact Model
